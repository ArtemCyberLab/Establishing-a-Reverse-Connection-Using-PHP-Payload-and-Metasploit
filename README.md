I worked on a project focused on using Metasploit to create and execute a PHP payload for establishing a Meterpreter session on a remote machine. I generated the PHP payload using msfvenom, specifying my IP address and port for the reverse connection. Then, I configured the handler in Metasploit to listen for incoming connections on the specified port. To transfer the payload to the target machine, I started an HTTP server on Kali Linux.

After that, I uploaded and executed the payload on the target system to establish a reverse connection to my host. During the process, I encountered some challenges, such as port conflicts and payload execution errors. I successfully resolved these issues by freeing up the port and recreating the payload. In the end, I managed to establish a connection and gain access to a Meterpreter session, which allowed me to interact with the target system.

This project allowed me to demonstrate my skills in using penetration testing tools like Metasploit and msfvenom, as well as my ability to troubleshoot and solve problems during vulnerability exploitation. I successfully completed the project, achieving the goal of gaining access to the remote system through Meterpreter.
